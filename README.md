Predict client behaviour (purchases and overall spend) based on trial marketing campaign results
**NOTE:** This is an exercise based on 'toy' data as Capstone project for Post-graduate Diploma in Applied Data Science
### Background ###

_Office Supplies Inc._ has completed a trial marketing campaign targeting 16000 customers and would like to understand the typical profile of those who have responded and generated revenue during the trial

Our modeling will enable marketing to selectively target those clients most likely to respond, in order to minimize campaign costs and maximize the profits during any further campaigns, as well as predict revenue generation

### Objectives ###
- Develop a model that will be able to predict the probability that a particular client profile will respond to the campaign with a purchase

- Provide a second model that can predict purchase revenue based on the customers profile features

- Group the clients by predicted dollar spend, then forecast marketing costs for the various grouped customers, and hence predict overall profit

- Effectively minimize campaign spend and maximize revenue through accurate targeting
